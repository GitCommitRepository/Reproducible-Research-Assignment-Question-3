Give a brief overview of the decisions you made along the way (in 100â€“200 words):



Downloading from the internet created problems with some of the files so I copied the content into R studio and saved the files with the right extensions.
I set the working directory and ran them in R Studio. I first uploaded them to github and then realised I should structure the respository in R Studio so I deleted the files out.
I created the directories: code, output and source_data because I find it easy to divide the files by these distinctions. I created files in GitHub for all but the oxford.txt, melbourne.csv and results.png, which I uploaded because they were too large to copy and paste or in the wrong format. I added code to the make-plot.R script to create a package-versions text file in the output directory and uploaded this file. This is to record the software versions I used.
I added a READ.ME file and started a licence but I cancelled it because the 'license holder' section removes annonymity.
