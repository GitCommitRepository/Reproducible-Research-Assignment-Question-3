# Reproducible-Research-Assignment-Question-3

This repository is for task 3 of the GitHub reproducible research MT22 homework assignment.
It contains files used to analyse data on the monthly average rainfall from 1855 to 2015 in Oxford and Melbourne.
The files are organised into the original data: source_data, the code used to process it: code, and the products of running the code: output.
One of the files in output is  'average_rainfall.csv' which is the output of the 'combine-data.R' script. It is also the data source for the 'make-plot.R; script.
